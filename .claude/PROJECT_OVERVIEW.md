# Waku Codex React Project Overview

## Project Structure

This project has a specific structure that must be understood before making any changes:

1. **Reference Implementation: `/cyphershare`**
   - This is a READ-ONLY directory
   - Use it as a guideline and reference for implementation patterns
   - You can run npm commands and tests here to understand functionality
   - DO NOT modify any files in this directory

2. **Main Project Directory: `/waku-codex-react`**
   - This is the primary working directory
   - All development and modifications should happen here
   - This is where we're building the main application using Waku, Codex, and React

3. **Claude Knowledge Base: `.claude`**
   - This directory is for storing notes and instructions for future Claude instances
   - Document learnings about Waku, Codex, and React development patterns here
   - Create organized notes as you discover important implementation details
   - This serves as persistent memory across Claude sessions

## Important Guidelines

- Always check the reference implementation in `/cyphershare` before implementing new features
- Document any important discoveries or patterns in the `.claude` directory
- Focus development efforts exclusively in `/waku-codex-react`
- When unsure about implementation details, refer to the reference implementation first

## Getting Started

1. First, familiarize yourself with the reference implementation structure
2. Check for any existing notes in the `.claude` directory
3. Begin work in the `/waku-codex-react` directory based on user requirements
